# hello-world
My first program to understand how GitHub works.

I'm a mechanical engineer pursuing a Master's in software engineering.  I've taken a few introductory programming
classes in C++ and currently a class in Java.  I'm also learning some Python on the side. I hope to develop my
skills using Git Hub and other resources as I prepare for my Master's and new career path.
